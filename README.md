# 42 C++ Modules Projects

This repository contains all 10 C++ modules from the 42 curriculum, designed to progressively develop skills in C++ programming â€” from basic concepts to advanced techniques and the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Module Details

### Module 00  
**Fundamentals of C++ and OOP Basics**  
This module introduces the main differences between C and C++, covering:  
- Basic C++ syntax (declarations, functions, namespaces)  
- Class design: attributes, methods, and encapsulation  
- Constructors and destructors for object lifecycle management  
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction  

### Module 01  
**Memory Management and Pointers**  
Focuses on memory handling and references, including:  
- Use of pointers and references in C++  
- Pointers to class members (methods and attributes)  
- Control flow with the `switch` statement  
- Differences in memory management compared to C  

### Module 02  
**Ad-hoc Polymorphism and Canonical Form**  
Covers ad-hoc polymorphism through:  
- Function and operator overloading for customized behavior  
- Implementation of the canonical form (Rule of Three/Five): copy constructor, copy assignment operator, destructor, move constructor, and move assignment operator  
- Proper resource management to avoid shallow copies and other issues  

### Module 03  
**Inheritance and Basic Polymorphism**  
Explores core inheritance concepts, including:  
- Creation of base and derived classes  
- Access specifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`) and their effects on inheritance  
- Introductory static and dynamic polymorphism  
- Use of virtual functions  

### Module 04  
**Subtype Polymorphism and Interfaces**  
Deepens the understanding of polymorphism by introducing:  
- Abstract classes and pure virtual functions  
- Interfaces to enforce implementation contracts  
- Flexible and extensible code design using inheritance and dynamic polymorphism  
- Interface-oriented design for decoupling
